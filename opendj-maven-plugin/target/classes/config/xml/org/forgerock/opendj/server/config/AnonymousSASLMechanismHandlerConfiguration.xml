  <adm:synopsis>
    The ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism provides the ability for clients to 
    perform an anonymous bind using a SASL mechanism. 
  </adm:synopsis>
  <adm:description>
    The only real 
    benefit that this provides over a normal anonymous bind (that is, 
    using simple authentication with no password) is that the ANONYMOUS 
    SASL mechanism also allows the client to include a trace string in 
    the request. This trace string can help identify the application that 
    performed the bind (although since there is no authentication, 
    there is no assurance that some other client did not spoof that 
    trace string).
