  <adm:synopsis>
    The
    <adm:user-friendly-name />
    provides a grouping mechanism in which the membership for the
    virtual static group is based on the membership for another group
    defined within the server.
  </adm:synopsis>
  <adm:description>
    The primary benefit of virtual static groups is that they make it
    possible to present other types of groups (for example, dynamic groups) as
    if they were static groups for the benefit of applications that do
    not support alternate grouping mechanisms.
