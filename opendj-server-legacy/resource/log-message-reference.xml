 <para>
  <olink targetdoc="admin-guide" targetptr="logging"/> describes logs.
  Access and audit logs concern client operations
  rather than OpenDJ directory server and tools, and so are not listed here.
  Instead, this appendix covers severe and fatal error messages
  for the directory server and its tools,
  such as those logged in <filename>/path/to/opendj/logs/errors</filename>,
  and <filename>/path/to/opendj/logs/replication</filename>.
