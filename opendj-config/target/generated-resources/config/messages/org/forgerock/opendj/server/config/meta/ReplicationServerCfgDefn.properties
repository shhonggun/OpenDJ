synopsis=Replication Servers publish updates to Directory Servers within a Replication Domain.
property.assured-timeout.synopsis=The timeout value when waiting for assured mode acknowledgments.
property.assured-timeout.description=Defines the number of milliseconds that the replication server will wait for assured acknowledgments (in either Safe Data or Safe Read assured sub modes) before forgetting them and answer to the entity that sent an update and is waiting for acknowledgment.
property.cipher-key-length.synopsis=Specifies the key length in bits for the preferred cipher.
property.cipher-key-length.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.
property.cipher-transformation.synopsis=Specifies the cipher for the directory server. The syntax is "algorithm/mode/padding".
property.cipher-transformation.description=The full transformation is required: specifying only an algorithm and allowing the cipher provider to supply the default mode and padding is not supported, because there is no guarantee these default values are the same among different implementations. Some cipher algorithms, including RC4 and ARCFOUR, do not have a mode or padding, and hence must be specified using NONE for the mode field and NoPadding for the padding field. For example, RC4/NONE/NoPadding.
property.cipher-transformation.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately but only affect cryptographic operations performed after the change.
property.compute-change-number.synopsis=Whether the replication server will compute change numbers.
property.compute-change-number.description=This boolean tells the replication server to compute change numbers for each replicated change by maintaining a change number index database. Changenumbers are computed according to http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-good-ldap-changelog-04. Note this functionality has an impact on CPU, disk accesses and storage. If changenumbers are not required, it is advisable to set this value to false.
property.confidentiality-enabled.synopsis=Indicates whether the replication change-log should make records readable only by Directory Server. Throughput and disk space are affected by the more expensive operations taking place.
property.confidentiality-enabled.description=Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting records on all domains managed by this replication server. Encrypting the records prevents unauthorized parties from accessing contents of LDAP operations. For complete protection, consider enabling secure communications between servers. Change number indexing is not affected by the setting.
property.confidentiality-enabled.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately but only affect operations performed after the change.
property.degraded-status-threshold.synopsis=The number of pending changes as threshold value for putting a directory server in degraded status.
property.degraded-status-threshold.description=This value represents a number of pending changes a replication server has in queue for sending to a directory server. Once this value is crossed, the matching directory server goes in degraded status. When number of pending changes goes back under this value, the directory server is put back in normal status. 0 means status analyzer is disabled and directory servers are never put in degraded status.
property.group-id.synopsis=The group id for the replication server.
property.group-id.description=This value defines the group id of the replication server. The replication system of a LDAP server uses the group id of the replicated domain and tries to connect, if possible, to a replication with the same group id.
property.monitoring-period.synopsis=The period between sending of monitoring messages.
property.monitoring-period.description=Defines the duration that the replication server will wait before sending new monitoring messages to its peers (replication servers and directory servers). Larger values increase the length of time it takes for a directory server to detect and switch to a more suitable replication server, whereas smaller values increase the amount of background network traffic.
property.queue-size.synopsis=Specifies the number of changes that are kept in memory for each directory server in the Replication Domain.
property.replication-db-directory.synopsis=The path where the Replication Server stores all persistent information.
property.replication-port.synopsis=The port on which this Replication Server waits for connections from other Replication Servers or Directory Servers.
property.replication-purge-delay.synopsis=The time (in seconds) after which the Replication Server erases all persistent information.
property.replication-server.synopsis=Specifies the addresses of other Replication Servers to which this Replication Server tries to connect at startup time.
property.replication-server.description=Addresses must be specified using the syntax: "hostname:port". If IPv6 addresses are used as the hostname, they must be specified using the syntax "[IPv6Address]:port".
property.replication-server.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A host name followed by a ":" and a port number.
property.replication-server-id.synopsis=Specifies a unique identifier for the Replication Server.
property.replication-server-id.description=Each Replication Server must have a different server ID.
property.source-address.synopsis=If specified, the server will bind to the address before connecting to the remote server.
property.source-address.description=The address must be one assigned to an existing network interface.
property.source-address.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.
property.weight.synopsis=The weight of the replication server.
property.weight.description=The weight affected to the replication server. Each replication server of the topology has a weight. When combined together, the weights of the replication servers of a same group can be translated to a percentage that determines the quantity of directory servers of the topology that should be connected to a replication server. For instance imagine a topology with 3 replication servers (with the same group id) with the following weights: RS1=1, RS2=1, RS3=2. This means that RS1 should have 25% of the directory servers connected in the topology, RS2 25%, and RS3 50%. This may be useful if the replication servers of the topology have a different power and one wants to spread the load between the replication servers according to their power.
property.window-size.synopsis=Specifies the window size that the Replication Server uses when communicating with other Replication Servers.
property.window-size.description=This option may be deprecated and removed in future releases.
