user-friendly-plural-name=Replication Service Discovery Mechanisms
synopsis=A Replication Service Discovery Mechanism returns the set of directory servers participating in a replication topology.
description=The Replication Service Discovery Mechanism specifies the replication servers whose configuration is periodically read to discover available replicas.
property.bind-dn.synopsis=The bind DN for periodically reading replication server configurations
property.bind-dn.description=The bind DN must be present on all replication servers and directory servers, it must be able to read the server configuration.
property.bind-password.synopsis=The bind password for periodically reading replication server configurations
property.bind-password.description=The bind password must be the same on all replication and directory servers
property.discovery-interval.synopsis=Interval between two replication server configuration discovery queries.
property.discovery-interval.description=Specifies how frequently to query a replication server configuration in order to discover information about available directory server replicas.
property.java-class.synopsis=Specifies the fully-qualified name of the Java class that provides the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism implementation.
property.key-manager-provider.synopsis=Specifies the name of the key manager that should be used with this Replication Service Discovery Mechanism.
property.key-manager-provider.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately, but only for subsequent attempts to access the key manager provider for associated client connections.
property.key-manager-provider.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced key manager provider must be enabled when the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism is enabled and configured to use SSL or StartTLS.
property.primary-group-id.synopsis=Replication domain group ID of preferred directory server replicas.
property.primary-group-id.description=Directory server replicas with this replication domain group ID will be preferred over other directory server replicas. Secondary server replicas will only be used when all primary server replicas become unavailable.
property.primary-group-id.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=All the server replicas will be treated the same.
property.replication-server.synopsis=Specifies the list of replication servers to contact periodically when discovering server replicas.
property.replication-server.syntax.string.pattern.synopsis=A host name followed by a ":" and a port number.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.synopsis=Specifies the nicknames (also called the aliases) of the keys or key pairs that the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism should use when performing SSL communication. The property can be used multiple times (referencing different nicknames) when server certificates with different public key algorithms are used in parallel (for example, RSA, DSA, and ECC-based algorithms). When a nickname refers to an asymmetric (public/private) key pair, the nickname for the public key certificate and associated private key entry must match exactly. A single nickname is used to retrieve both the public key and the private key.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.description=This is only applicable when the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism is configured to use SSL.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.
property.trust-manager-provider.synopsis=Specifies the name of the trust manager that should be used with the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism.
property.trust-manager-provider.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Use the trust manager provided by the JVM.
property.trust-manager-provider.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately, but only for subsequent attempts to access the trust manager provider for associated client connections.
property.trust-manager-provider.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced trust manager provider must be enabled when the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism is enabled and configured to use SSL or StartTLS.
property.use-ssl.synopsis=Indicates whether the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism should use SSL.
property.use-ssl.description=If enabled, the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism will use SSL to encrypt communication with the clients.
property.use-start-tls.synopsis=Indicates whether the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism should use Start TLS.
property.use-start-tls.description=If enabled, the Replication Service Discovery Mechanism will use Start TLS to encrypt communication with remote servers.
