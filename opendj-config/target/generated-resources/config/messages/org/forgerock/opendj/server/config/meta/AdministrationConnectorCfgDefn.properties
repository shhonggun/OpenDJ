user-friendly-plural-name=Administration Connectors
synopsis=The Administration Connector is used to interact with administration tools using LDAP.
description=It is a dedicated entry point for administration.
property.key-manager-provider.synopsis=Specifies the name of the key manager that is used with the Administration Connector .
property.key-manager-provider.syntax.aggregation.constraint-synopsis=The referenced key manager provider must be enabled.
property.listen-address.synopsis=Specifies the address or set of addresses on which this Administration Connector should listen for connections from LDAP clients.
property.listen-address.description=Multiple addresses may be provided as separate values for this attribute. If no values are provided, then the Administration Connector listens on all interfaces.
property.listen-port.synopsis=Specifies the port number on which the Administration Connector will listen for connections from clients.
property.listen-port.description=Only a single port number may be provided.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.synopsis=Specifies the nicknames (also called the aliases) of the keys or key pairs that the Administration Connector should use when performing SSL communication. The property can be used multiple times (referencing different nicknames) when server certificates with different public key algorithms are used in parallel (for example, RSA, DSA, and ECC-based algorithms). When a nickname refers to an asymmetric (public/private) key pair, the nickname for the public key certificate and associated private key entry must match exactly. A single nickname is used to retrieve both the public key and the private key.
property.ssl-cert-nickname.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Let the server decide.
property.ssl-cipher-suite.synopsis=Specifies the names of the SSL cipher suites that are allowed for use in SSL communication.
property.ssl-cipher-suite.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Uses the default set of SSL cipher suites provided by the server's JVM.
property.ssl-cipher-suite.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately but will only impact new SSL/TLS-based sessions created after the change.
property.ssl-protocol.synopsis=Specifies the names of the SSL protocols that are allowed for use in SSL or StartTLS communication.
property.ssl-protocol.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Uses the default set of SSL protocols provided by the server's JVM.
property.ssl-protocol.requires-admin-action.synopsis=Changes to this property take effect immediately but only impact new SSL/TLS-based sessions created after the change.
property.trust-manager-provider.synopsis=Specifies the name of the trust manager that is used with the Administration Connector .
property.trust-manager-provider.default-behavior.alias.synopsis=Use the trust manager provided by the JVM.
