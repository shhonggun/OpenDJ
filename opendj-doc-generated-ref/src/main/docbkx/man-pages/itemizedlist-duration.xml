   Some property values take a time duration.
   Durations are expressed as numbers followed by units.
   For example <literal>1 s</literal> means one second,
   and <literal>2 w</literal> means two weeks.
   Some durations have minimum granularity or maximum units,
   so you cannot necessary specify every duration
   in milliseconds or weeks for example.
   Some durations allow you to use a special value to mean unlimited.
   Units are specified as follows.
