  This utility thus performs only part of the upgrade process,
  which includes the following phases for a single server.
 </para>

 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Get and unpack a newer version of OpenDJ directory server software.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Stop the current OpenDJ directory server.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Overwrite existing binary and script files with those of the newer version,
    and then run this utility before restarting OpenDJ.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Start the upgraded OpenDJ directory server.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>

 <important>
  <para>
   This utility <emphasis>does not back up OpenDJ before you upgrade,
   nor does it restore OpenDJ if the utility fails</emphasis>.
   In order to revert a failed upgrade,
   make sure you back up OpenDJ directory server
   before you overwrite existing binary and script files.
  </para>
 </important>

 <para>
  By default this utility requests confirmation
  before making important configuration changes.
  You can use the <option>--no-prompt</option> option
  to run the command non-interactively.
 </para>

 <para>
  When using the <option>--no-prompt</option> option,
  if this utility cannot complete
  because it requires confirmation for a potentially very long or critical task,
  then it exits with an error and
  a message about how to finish making the changes.
  You can add the <option>--force</option> option
  to force a non-interactive upgrade to continue in this case,
  also performing long running and critical tasks.
 </para>

 <para>
  After upgrading, see the resulting <filename>upgrade.log</filename> file
  for a full list of operations performed.
